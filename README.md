## Hi, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm Rudra!

I'm a 18 year old Web Developer. I have a serious passion for coding and software development.
I'm an excellent problem solver in both real life and on computers. Right now I am focusing the most on making good projects for my portfolio and writing clean, understandable, and high-quality code.
